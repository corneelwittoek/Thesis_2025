# Thesis_2025
Extra files for my thesis 'A spatially explicit forest growth model for managing Prunus serotina: a case study of the Clingse Bossen, The Netherlands'. Start-parameter files need to be modified by the R script 'write_klimaat_simulationfiles.R'. The SORTIE-ND code must be modified with NCIMasterMortality.cpp to allow for seedlings to be included in the juvenile mortality behavior. Instructions for setting up the SORTIE-ND code can be found on http://sortie-nd.org/help/manuals/developer_documentation/software/code_installation.html. When building the code, simply replace the original 'NCIMasterMortality.cpp' with the updated one.
